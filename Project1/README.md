# Project Overview
This project involves handling data from a newly implemented card swipe system in classrooms, designed to track attendance. The data comprises two key components:

Course Roster: Contains a list of names representing students enrolled in a specific lecture.

Attendance Records (Swipe Log): Consists of a list of strings, each detailing a student's swipe.

Each string includes: student's name in the format "Last, First.", timestamp of the swipe in military time, and date of the swipe.

The provided dataEntry.py functions are integral for parsing and utilizing these datasets.
