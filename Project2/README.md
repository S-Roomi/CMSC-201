This project focuses on using a Dictionary to track student attendance, where student names serve as keys and associated lists record login timestamps. 


Key Aspects:

Dictionary Configuration:

Key assignments involve students' names.
Login timestamps are aggregated in lists as associated values.

File IO Integration:
The focal point is the creation of a robust file reader function.
Preliminary manual data entry is admissible for preliminary testing, but its ultimate substitution with the automated file reader function is mandated for the finalized version.

  
Example Data Files:
  
Roster.txt exclusively encompasses student names.
DataAllShow1stClass.txt encapsulates a singular day of login data.
DataAllShow1stAnd2ndClass.txt extends its scope to include login data for two consecutive days.
